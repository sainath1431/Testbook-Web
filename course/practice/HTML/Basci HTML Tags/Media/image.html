    Attribute src = " location or path of Out Image"  this path can be anywhere  it can be in drive , you can put images in same folder , even you can specify url over there.

    writing the correct extension of image is must.

    In image we can attribute like 'width' and 'height' to adjust the size of the image.

    Note : if your image failed to load you have see the broken image icon. for this multiple reasons behind it for example , low internet connection, may be incorrect path of image etc.

    In image tag alt attribute works when the image is failed to load some reason then they show the alternate text for that image so we can easily identify the which image is failed to load.

    In image tag 'title' attribute shows description of image when cursor goes on the image.
